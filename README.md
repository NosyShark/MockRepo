# MockRepo
This is MockRepo (II) - a place to try to get to know how R communicates with github. 
The data I have chosen are fictional and random. 
Through the ages there have been arguments between warring goblin houses as to which lineage boasts the most and biggest bogeys. Alas! There need no longer be any bloodshed as - with some R and github skullduggery - this dispute can finally be settled. (No goblins were hurt in the making of this.)

- These data were captured in GoogleSheets
- Tidied in R
- Plotted in R
