# MockRepo
This is MockRepo (II) 
<br> A place to try to get to know how R communicates with github. 
<br> The data I have chosen are fictional and random. 
<br> Through the ages there have been arguments between warring goblin houses as to which lineage boasts the most and biggest bogeys. Alas! There need no longer be any bloodshed as - with some R and github skullduggery - this dispute can finally be settled. 
<br>

These data were captured in GoogleSheet
<br> I added an excel version in the data file for easy access
<br> Tidied the data in R according to House -> gobnumH
<br> Tidied the data in R according to Nose Size -> gobnumS
<br> Tidied the data in R accoring to Colour -> gobnumC
<br> Tidied the data in R according to Dry and Wetness -> gobnumDW
<br> Plotted the data of all these variables in R
<br>

Folders
<br> Data - excel sheet of the raw data
<br> Output - PNGs of goblin snot
<br> Code - R script to tidy data and create plots

<br>(No goblins were hurt in the making of this.)
